{{% pageinfo %}}
Arm SystemReady is a compliance certification program based on a set of hardware and firmware standards: Base System Architecture (BSA) and Base Boot Requirements (BBR) specifications, plus a selection of supplements. This ensures that subsequent layers of software also ‘just work’. The compliance certification program tests and certifies that systems meet the SystemReady standards, giving confidence that operating systems (OS) and subsequent layers of software just work.
