    This is a tutorial to create a benchmark to measure performance on a Cortex-M CPU runnning RTL simulation
---
## Identify a benchmark

Get the source code

## Get the Cortex-M startup code

This provides the basics to start the processor and measure cycles

## Build

Build the benchmark 

## Run

Execute on the RTL simulator

## Review the cycle counts

Look at the cycle counts to see how long the benchmark takes

## Use the Tarmac trace tool
