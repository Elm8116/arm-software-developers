{{< card header="**[Arm A-Profile architecture](https://https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/A-Profile%20Architecture)**" >}}

The Arm Application-profile (A-profile) architecture targets high performance markets, such as PC, mobile, gaming, and servers.

{{< card header="**[Arm R-Profile architecture](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/R-Profile%20Architecture)**" >}}

The Arm Real-time profile (R-profile) architecture provides a standard instruction set and programmer's model and has some degree of backward compatibility. The R-profile provides high-performing processors for timing sensitive and safety-critical environments.

{{< card header="**[Arm M-Profile architecture](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/M-Profile%20Architecture)**" >}}

The Arm Microcontroller-profile (M-profile) architecture provides a standard instruction sets and programmer models for secure microprocessors that are optimized for the lowest power consumption, low-latency and highly deterministic operation for deeply embedded systems.

{{< card header="**[Scalable Vector Extentions](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Scalable%20Vector%20Extensions)**" >}}

Scalable Vector Extension (SVE and SVE2)) are vector extensions the A64 instruction set. SVE and SVE2 do not define the size of the vector registers, but constrains it to a range of possible values, from a minimum of 128 bits up to a maximum of 2048 in 128-bit wide units.

{{< card header="**[Neon](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon)**" >}}

Arm Neon technology is an advanced Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture extension for the A-profile and R-profile processors.

{{< card header="**[Helium](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Helium)**" >}}

Arm Helium technology is for the Arm Cortex-M processor series and is also known as the M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE). Helium is an optional extension in the Armv8.1-M architecture and delivers a significant performance uplift for machine learning (ML) and digital signal processing (DSP) applications for small, low power embedded devices.
