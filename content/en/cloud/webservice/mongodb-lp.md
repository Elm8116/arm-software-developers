    Learning path for software developers using MongoDB as their database for mobile, IoT applications, content management or real-time analytics running on Arm servers.  
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run MongoDB on your 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance
* Use an open-sourced java application to test MongoDB performance on 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance
* Run Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark(YCSB) to measure and compare the performance of MongoDB on Arm versus other architectures.


## Pre-requisites

* An Amazon Web Services(AWS) account. 
* Some familiarity with launching and running EC2 instances in AWS is helpful but not necessary.
