## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run Vectorscan on your 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance
* Install and run Snort3 on your 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance
* Run Snort3 with Vectorscan on capture files and and measure performance


## Pre-requisites

* An Amazon Web Services(AWS) account. 
* Some familiarity with launching and running EC2 instances in AWS is helpful but not necessary.
