[Arm Flexible Access](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access) provides up-front, no-cost or low-cost access to a wide range of Arm IP, tools, and training. Experiment and design with the entire portfolio; license fees, if any, are only due at the point of manufacture and calculated only on the IP included in the final SoC design. 

Review the [FAQ](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access/faqs) for an overview.

[Training videos](https://developer.arm.com/Training/Arm%20On-demand%20Training%20-%20Flexible%20Access#Technical-Specifications) are also available.

In addition to the ability to download Arm IP, Arm Flexible Access provides tools included in Arm Success Kits and as well as access to Arm IP Explorer.

SoC architects use Arm IP Explorer to search, configure, and simulate Arm IP in a browser. Use your Arm account to access Arm IP Explorer. If you have an Arm account but have not yet accessed IP Explorer you will be presented with a button to request access. 

Software developers use Arm IP Explorer to execute custom software and benchmarks to contribute to IP selection. 

Source code for sample benchmarks are provided as well as a template to create custom benchmarks, complete with startup code and a build environment.
