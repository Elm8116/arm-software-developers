## Introduction

[Arm Instruction Emulator](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Instruction%20Emulator) is a software tool that runs on 64-bit Arm platforms and emulates [Scalable Vector Extension(SVE)] (https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102476/latest/instructions). This tool allows you to run your compiled SVE application binaries on hardware that is not SVE-enabled.


## Pre-requisites

Arm InstructionEmulator is an executable that runs on your Linux host. It runs on RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu Linux distributions.
You must ensure that either [Environment Modules] (https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or the [Lmod Environment Module System] (https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are installed on your host Linux machine.

On the supported Linux hosts, use gcc 7.1.0 or higher

More information is given in [the developer and reference guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102190/22-0).

## Download installer packages {#download}

You can download the appropriate Arm Instruction emulator package for your host Linux platform from [Product Downloads section]((https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-instruction-emulator)) of the Arm website. 

Full installation instructions are provided [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102190/22-0/Get-started/Install-Arm-Instruction-Emulator).

## Setting up product license {#license}

Arm Instruction Emulator is freely available and not license managed. You can view the third party license information for the open source software included with the latest version of Arm Instruction Emulator [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-instruction-emulator/third-party-licenses)

## Get started {#start}

To verify everything is working OK post-install refer to the [Get started with Arm Instruction Emulator](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102190/22-0/Get-started/Get-started-with-Arm-Instruction-Emulator?lang=en). It uses a couple of simple examples to demonstrate how to compile Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) code and run the resulting binary with ArmÂ® Instruction Emulator.
