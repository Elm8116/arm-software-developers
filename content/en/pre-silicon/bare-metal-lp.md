    Learning path for software developers new to Arm and developing bare-metal software for Arm devices. 
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Build your first application running on an Arm virtual platform
* Understand the boot code and linker file structure and syntax used to create the application
* Modify the same application to use different I/O mechanisms
* Use the techniques learned to create your own custom application


## Pre-requisites
 
* Arm Fast Models. View the [Getting Started](/models/getting_started) guide if you are unfamiliar.
* Prior experience developing embedded software is helpful but not necessary.
