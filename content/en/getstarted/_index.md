    Get started with Arm Success Kits.

Arm Success Kits provide users with full access to a wide range of Arm Development Tools. If you are unfamiliar with the products, it may seem overwhewlming at first. This guide is to help you select the right tool for your needs.

# Select the right toolchain

The Software Success Kit contains 4 distinct suites of tools for software development. Each suite contains appropriate tools for a particular use case.

## Arm Development Studio

This is the most comprehensive embedded software development suite, supporting all Arm processors within the Arm Flexible Access program. It contains the industry leading Arm Compiler for Embedded, as well as a license for the Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa (installed separately) for developers working in safety critical segments. This powerful tool can debug, trace, and profile the most advanced multi-core systems. Development Studio is hosted on Windows and Linux platforms.

## Keil Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK)

Keil MDK is a toolchain for developers working with Cortex-M microcontrollers. It is also provided with Arm Compiler for Embedded and enables Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa. Designed around the CMSIS industry standard, it supports 9500+ microcontrollers. MDK is hosted on Windows platforms only.

## Arm Mobile Studio

Arm Mobile Studio is a suite of performance analysis tools that analyze the CPU activity, GPU activity and content metrics of your game as it runs on a non-rooted Android device. The Professional Edition enables users to integrate into a continuous integration (CI) development flow.

## Arm Allinea Studio

Arm Allinea Studio is a suite of tools for developing server and HPC applications on Arm-based platforms. It contains Arm-specific (C/C++/Fortran) compilers and libraries, plus debug and optimization tools.

# Other components of Success Kits
## Arm Fast Models

[Arm Fast Models](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fast%20Models) are accurate, flexible programmer's view models of Arm IP. They are used to build a virtual platform, either standalone, or as part of Hybrid Simulation environment within EDA partner environments. Use the virtual platform for software development and verification throughout the development process, even long before any real hardware is available.

Arm also provides a library of [Fixed Virtual Platforms](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms) (FVPs), a set of pre-built systems to enable you to run and debug code 'out-of-the-box'. A number of the FVP platforms are also installed as part of Arm Development Studio and MDK.

A HSK license is needed to configure and build your own custom virtual platform (with the System Canvas tool). An SSK license allows you to run pre-built models (either FVPs or your own custom models).

## Arm Socrates

[Socrates](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Socrates) is a tool to help you select, configure, and create Arm IP. A HSK license is needed to run Socrates. Additional licenses for the Arm IP being configured may also be needed.

## AMBA Viz

AMBA Viz is a bus protocol visualization tool. It allows you to easily visualize simulations and view the interconnect topology. You can piece together and track complex coherent transaction, measure latency and bandwidth, decode interconnect packet fields, and measure clock cycles. A HSK license is needed to run AMBA Viz.

# Download and install

All downloads are provided via the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads). You can select individual components or entire success kit bundles. Your organization may also have a nominated contact to manage an internal repository of all of these tools. All components are license managed.

For more detailed information on setting up your license, go to [the install instructions](/successkits/install)
