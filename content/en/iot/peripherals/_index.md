## Overview

Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) supports [Virtual Interfaces](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/simulation/html/group__arm__cmvp.html) which can be used to simulate real world peripherals and stimuli.

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:
* Create a peripheral using Virtual Input/Output (VIO)
* Virtual Streaming Interface (VSI)
* Virtual Socket Interface (VSocket)

## Pre-requisites

* [An Arm Virtual Hardware instance running in the cloud](/iot/aws/launch)
* Some knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/) syntax.
