[Arm Flexible Access](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access) provides up-front, no-cost or low-cost access to a wide range of Arm IP, tools, and training. Experiment and design with the entire portfolio; license fees, if any, are only due at the point of manufacture and calculated only on the IP included in the final SoC design. 

Review the [FAQ](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access/faqs) for an overview.

[Training videos](https://developer.arm.com/Training/Arm%20On-demand%20Training%20-%20Flexible%20Access#Technical-Specifications) are also available.

SoC architects use Arm IP Explorer to search, configure, and simulate Arm IP in a browser. Use your Arm account to access Arm IP Explorer. If you have an Arm account but have not yet accessed IP Explorer you will be presented with a button to request access. 

It can be used to create block diagrams and collaborate with colleages. It's a new tool for IP selection and helpful Arm Flexbile Access subscribers.

Software developers use Arm IP Explorer to execute custom software and benchmarks to contribute to IP selection. 

Source code for sample benchmarks are provided as well as a template to create custom benchmarks, complete with startup code and a [build environment](https://github.com/jasonrandrews/ipx-custom-software).

Information about Arm Approved Design Partners who can help is also found in Arm Ip Explorer.

{{< card header="**[Arm IP Download](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/search#Arm%20Flexible%20Access)**" >}}
Download the IP, software, and tools from the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/)

The Product Download Hub allows you to search, browse and download from Arm's product catalogue.

It's easy to search and navigate to find Arm products and download them. The service is optimized for large file download.

Login using your Arm account to access the Product Download Hub.
