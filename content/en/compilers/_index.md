{{% pageinfo %}}
There are many C/C++ compilers for the Arm architecture. To know which compiler you need consider the variables below.

Target environment where you want the compiled software to run:<br>
- Bare metal or real-time operating system (RTOS)
- Linux kernel and applications
- Android applications
- Windows applications

Architecture of the processor where you want to run the compiled software:
- AArch32
- AArch64

You may need to know the family of processors you are targeting:
- Cortex-M
- Cortex-R
- Cortex-A
- Neoverse 

Host machine, where you will do the compiling:
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

Architecture of the host machine:
- x86
- Arm

There are also special compilers for functional safety.

There are open source compilers (free) and commercial compilers (not free).

This page provides an orientation to understand the available compilers, where to get them, and how to install them.

Arm Compiler for Embedded is a **commercial, bare metal cross-compiler** for all Arm processors. 

Host machine support includes:
- Windows (x86) 
- Linux (x86 and Arch64)

There is also a dedicated version for [functional safety](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa)

{{< card header="**[GNU Toolchain](ihttps://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)**" >}}
The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an **open source, bare metal cross-compiler** for all Arm processors.

This version of GCC is provided by Arm on the Arm Developer website. Additional flavors of GCC are covered below.

Host machine support includes:
- Windows (x86) 
- Linux (x86 and AArch64)
- macOS (x86)

{{< card header="**[Arm Compiler for Linux](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux)**" >}}
Arm Compiler for Linux is a **commercial, native compiler** for Linux HPC applications on 64-bit Armv8-A processors such as Neoverse-N1. it consists of:
- Arm C/C++ Compiler
- Arm Fortran Compiler
- Arm Performance Libraries

Host machine support includes:
- Linux (AArch64)

It can run on a variety of Linux distributions.

{{< card header="**[GCC native on Linux]()**" >}}
GCC is available on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager. 

[Install native GCC compiler on Linux](install_ngcc/)

{{< card header="**[GCC Cross-compile on Linux]()**" >}}
GCC is also available as a cross compiler on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager.

This can be useful to target bare metal applications or cross compile for the Arm architecture when you are running x86 Linux.
