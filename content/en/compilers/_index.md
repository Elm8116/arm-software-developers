{{% pageinfo %}}
There are many C/C++ compilers for the Arm architecture. To know which compiler you need consider the variables below.

Target environment where you want the compiled software to run:<br>
- Bare metal or real-time operating system (RTOS)
- Linux kernel and applications
- Android applications
- Windows applications

Architecture of the processor where you want to run the compiled software:
- AArch32
- AArch64

You may need to know the family of processors you are targeting:
- Cortex-M
- Cortex-R
- Cortex-A
- Neoverse 

Host machine, where you will do the compiling:
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

Architecture of the host machine:
- x86
- Arm

There are also special compilers for functional safety.

This page provides an orientation to understand the available compilers, where to get them, and how to install them.

GCC is available on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager. 

On Debian based distributions use:
```console
sudo apt install g++
```

{{< card header="**[GCC Cross-compile on Linux]()**" >}}
GCC is also available as a cross compiler on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager.
This can be useful to target bare metal applications or cross compile for the Arm architecture when you are running x86 Linux.

On Debian based distributions use:
```console
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
