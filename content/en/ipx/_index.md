SoC architects use Arm IP Explorer to search, configure, and simulate Arm IP in a browser. Use your Arm account to access Arm IP Explorer. If you have an Arm account but have not yet accessed IP Explorer you will be presented with a button to request access. 

It can be used to create block diagrams and collaborate with colleages. It's a new tool for IP selection and helpful Arm Flexbile Access subscribers.

Software developers use Arm IP Explorer to execute custom software and benchmarks to contribute to IP selection. 

Source code for sample benchmarks are provided as well as a template to create custom benchmarks, complete with startup code and a build environment.

Information about Arm Approved Design Partners who can help is also found in Arm IP Explorer.

Use the Access IP Explorer link below and use your Arm account to login. If your account is not configured for access you will see a "Request Access" button. Click the botton to enable IP Explorer for your account.
